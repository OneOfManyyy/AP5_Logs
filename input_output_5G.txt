Input Configurations of the measurement:
	protocol = 'TCP'  # Choose 'TCP' or 'UDP'
	Port = 5201 # it's just the port number, no significant meaning
	duration = 1  # Test duration in seconds
	bandwidth = 'infinite'  # Max bandwidth (e.g., '10M' for 10 Mbps, '1G' for 1 Gbps, or 'infinite' for uncapped)
	num_streams = 4  # Number of parallel streams
	
	These are not written in the logs.
	num_runs = 1000  # Number of times to repeat
	blksize = 131072 # for TCP default = 131072, UDP default = 1402

	Throughput (Mbps)
	RTT (ms)
	Retransmits 
	Jitter (ms) # only UDP
