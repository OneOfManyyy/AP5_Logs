ran with clients 3,4,5

3 clients side by side, server 2 meters away
put all of the dongles slightly outside of the window

client 4 dc after 1 run and cant continue. probably cuz of tcp. 
might get solved if the distance of dongles increases or the BW cap is reduced

1000000 BW
20 runs 
length for all 10 sec
